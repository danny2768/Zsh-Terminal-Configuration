(The background belongs to the desktop, terminal is transparent)
## Themes
Please note that the themes part of the configuration depends on [Alacritty themes](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme)
Install them from their repo or clone this folder (alacritty) in the following path: `~/.config/`

## Font
The font configured is MesloLGS Nerd Font.
I suggest you to download it from [this link](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/master/patched-fonts/Meslo/S/Regular/MesloLGSNerdFont-Regular.ttf) or see the patched nerd-fonts to ensure compatibility.
